# game-portfolio
an interactive "8-bit game" stylised portfolio that I built using Javascript and HTML which includes my resume, my youtube and lots of other candid dialogues. The task was made fairly easier by utilising kaboom library.
The 8-bit map layout was created using [Tiled Software](https://www.mapeditor.org/) and the spritesheet for which I was able to acquire [here](https://github.com/JSLegendDev/2d-portfolio-kaboom/blob/master/public/spritesheet.png).
